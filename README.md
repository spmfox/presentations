# Presentations
## About
Here are various presentations I've given. Each one has files, GIFs, and source code available.

If GIFs are used for a demo, the code used to generate the video will be under the `vhs` folder.

Each time a presentation is spoken live, a branch will be created to capture the repo at that time.

You can read the presentations as rendered markdown in this repo, or view the hosted HTML versions below.

## Hosted HTML versions of the presentations:
